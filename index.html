<p>A graduate student at the Institute has been developing a web-based, window graphical user interface (gui). The student
    is gathering data on memory usage when windows are discarded into a red discard zone.  Please help him out by
    dragging the window into the red zone.  The student was also testing out some camera software, and may not
    have disabled it before he submitted the prototype. </p>

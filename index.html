<h1>Window Study</h1>
<p>A graduate student at the Institute has been developing a web-based, window graphical user interface (gui). The student
    is gathering data on memory usage when windows are put into a red zone.  Please help him out by
    putting the windows into the red zone.  The student will record you while performing the tasks,
    but will not keep the recordings.</p>
